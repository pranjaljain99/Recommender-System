review/summary: Making the cut!
review/text: Looked all over in art supply and other stores for "crazy cutting" scissors for my 4-year old grandson. These are exactly what I was looking for - fun, very well made, metal rather than plastic blades (so they actually do a good job of cutting paper), safe ("blunt") ends, etc. (These really are for age 4 and up, not younger.) Very high quality. Very pleased with the product.

review/text: These are the BEST scissors I have ever owned. I am left-handed and take note that either a left or right-handed person can use these equally well.If you have arthritis, as I do, these scissors are amazing as well. Well worth the price. I now own three pairs of these and have convinced many other people in my quilting group that they NEED a pair as well!They cut through muli layers and difficult to cut items really well.Do buy them, you won't regret it!

review/text: I finally gave in and bought these after years of wanting them. I'm so glad I did!I'm a book artist and crafter, and I usually do my creative work in marathon stretches. (You know, nothing for three weeks and then an all-day session...) These scissors make it so much easier. They cut easily and cleanly, with no hand fatigue. They also saved me when I did all my Christmas gift wrapping.I should have just bought these in the first place!

review/text: This is my second pair of Fiskar multi-purpose scissors. I got the first pair 6 years ago and used them constantly in my art studio for all kinds of cutting. They worked perfectly until I accidentally stepped on them. These scissors are extremely comfortable, stay sharper than the traditional kind, and work beautifully.

review/summary: Not Very Sharp
review/text: Like the previous reviewer, I was very happy to be able to order safety pins on-line. I live in a small town, and they are impossible to find. These safety pins are very large- about 2.25" long. Also, they are not very sharp. I used them to pin 2-3 garments together for a children's clothing resale, and had a VERY difficult time getting the point to go through in both directions. This was true on all types of fabric from denim to cotton to jersey. The dull point of one of these safety pins tore a hole in one polo-style, jersey shirt!

review/summary: Nice Large Basic Safety Pins
review/text: ****These are your basic large safety pins and come in a package of 65. I always found myself buying assortments of safety pins and using up all of the large ones first, so these solve a problem for me. These safety pins are all the same size, called a "Size 3" as far as safety pin sizes go, but actually are two inches or 5.1 centimeters long. They are nickel-plated, not fancy, but do the job just fine. Save yourself a lot of time hunting these down in stores by buying them here on Amazon! They seem sharp enough for the uses I have for them; however, I don't think they would be good for any extra fine work, as they are just general-usage quality.Recommended.****

review/summary: Cheap metal
review/text: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant.

I don't have an artistic or accurate eye, so often times my straight lines are actually cady-wonker. The grid is amazingly useful and has had every angle I needed!This mat has sped up many projects in conjunction with the rotary blades from Olfa. It used to take days of cutting (I have arthritis) and now I get it all done in an afternoon.

review/summary: Pretty Basic
review/text: The canvas is nice and heavy and the support is strong. Though I find it a bit heavy for the size of the canvas. It wasn't quite fully stretched and required a bit of work to keep it from bulging throughout the painting process. Required some priming (just basic gesso) before painting. I tried do paint without it at first and the canvas just soaked up my acrylics. Even texture throughout the canvas made it easier once the gesso had been put on. Overall, a pretty basic stretched canvas. Great for the price on all 6 at once though.

review/summary: Good quality, minor flaws
review/text: I bought these to make my own stretched canvases and to stretch some paintings I'd already done. When I got these, the first thing I noticed is they ranged greatly in color, dark wood to light wood. Although it's not really that important as only a very little bit of the frame shows through the back, and none at all once hanged. The only other thing I'd have liked is if they were cut a little more cleanly. The ends aren't as smooth as the picture and if you're not careful, they could easily give you a splinter.Other than that these are very nice. Once put together they seem sturdy and they're light enough to make hanging them not a problem. They make a great deal too.

review/text: I used Golden's Hard Molding Paste on a raised stencil design and it worked perfectly, very smooth finish. There are other mediums to use with raised stencils, but often need to be polished later, a dusty job.The height of the design will depend on what the user wants - either slightly raised, or a higher finish. It is put on like cake frosting, very easy to do, using no muscle. I love it.

review/summary: Great Buy
review/text: I actually bought this item from "Amazon Warehouse" used but "Like New" condition. When they say "Like New" it's pretty darn close. The compressor came in it's original box with all accessories in their original plastic package and the cords spooled up as if it came from the factory. I haven't yet seen a blemish on the unit itself. It really is in like new condition (and was $60 cheaper than a new unit from Amazon).This compressor is great. I was originally considering the Smart Jet (non-Pro) however what pushed me over is that if you lower the air pressure on the Smart Jet it achieves a lower pressure by a bleed valve which just lets the air run out. The result is that the auto-shutoff feature of the Smart Jet is then rendered useless and the compressor just runs constantly. This compressor however has a true regulator and you can decrease the pressure without loosing the auto-shutoff functionality. It also has a "protective case" around it.----------------------------Update October 2012A year and a half later and the compressor is still doing great. I also have a larger shop compressor used for pneumatic tools, and compare to that this unit is way quieter. The tank fills up in about 30 seconds then it shuts off and is quiet. It's nice to be able to paint things at night, 10PM or 11PM, without worrying about how it will affect others in the house or the neighbor. If I had to buy another air brush compressor for some reason... well, I think I might just buy a 2nd one of these.

review/text: I bought this to replace my Omas black ink that was running out to use in my Lamy 2000 fountain pen. The ink flows fine and gives even coverage on the two kind of paper I commonly use, I would definitely recommend it. The ink lost one star because it is a dark, dark grey rather than a true black as was the Omas but only suffers when held right next to one another. I don't know if this is due to the paper I am using. Also it seems this ink drys a little slower and thus smudges somewhat easier, this is NOT an objective measurement however but a feeling and obviously will depend on the paper used.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Noodler's Ink. The company believes in providing a quality product at a reasonable price. I haven't used a Noodler's ink that I wasn't pleased with. The standard bulletproof black is one of my favorites. It is a very well behaved ink with almost no feathering or bleed through even on the crummiest of paper. It is a little bit on the drier side, but no so much that it is a problem even in drier pens. I use it everyday.

review/summary: Top-shelf fountain pen ink
review/text: Noodler's Black Bulletproof is my go-to ink for serious work. It's waterproof, fraud-proof, and will write well on any kind of paper. This is the only fountain pen ink I know that can be used for crossword puzzles on newspaper pulp without feathering or bleeding through. Once the ink dries on the page, it's not removable. I once ran a note through the laundry in the pocket of my jeans, and the writing was still perfectly legible when I discovered the washed piece of paper in the pocket later.This is well-behaved ink, with only one minor drawback: it exhibits nib creep in most pens. If you don't care about seeing a bit of ink riding the top of the nib as you write, this is not an issue, and the great properties of Noodler's Black more than make up for it.If you write with a fountain pen, and you want an ink that's smooth, waterproof, and rock-solid permanent once it dries, there's really only one pick...Noodler's Black Bulletproof.

review/text: This ink works as it's supposed to. I use it in a Lamy Safari Grey, and it has become my "main" pen. I use it for filling out repair orders at work, practicing handwriting, and filling out important documents and writing checks. This combination brings the tactile feel of writing back to mundane documents. I am not good at it but it has also brought a certain "organic" feel to my doodles and small cartoons, that otherwise would be lacking. Quality products are in short supply, be sure to support vendors/manufactures who continue to bring them to the public!!

review/text: I love this ink!I love using fountain pens, but I always have to carry a regular pen with me, because the ink isn't waterproof (no good for checks and important notes). Well now it is!This ink works great! It dries quickly, leaves a nice dark line, and is completely waterproof!I'm so thrilled about discovering this ink that I ordered it in a bunch of colors and even ordered some extra pens, because now I will be able to use my fountain pens for everything!The only drawback that I see about this ink is that it smells a bit (to my nose), but I don't inhale it I just write with it, so its benefits well out way this minor issue.WARNING!!! Noodlers gives you your money's worth--they fill the bottle to the very tippy-top! The first time you open the bottle, make sure it is on a level surface and open slowly and carefully. I recommend putting it on some newspaper or a paper towel to open.

This ink was VERY dark and got the job done.I live in earthquake-prone California, and a recent quake knocked books off of my shelf. My Noodler's ink was on the shelf as well and consequentially fell too, shattering the glass bottle. Luckily, the tile was wiped clean and the ink left no stain :)I decided that I would need replacement ink ASAP since I was working on a project. I headed over to an office supply store and bought a generic bottle of Parker Quink Ink in black. But as I started to sketch, I noticed that this ink was more of a gray in comparison to the almost abyssal Noodler's ink.Having said this, I am back to purchase another bottle of this Noodler's Bulletproof Black. It is simply the best.WARNING: This ink will spoil you for all other inks!

review/summary: Good Ink but NOT Waterproof
review/text: Doesn't feather, with a sharp, crisp, dense line. Slow dries on quality paper where it tends to sit on top rather than be quickly absorbed (cheaper paper). But where it fails as a drawing ink is that it lightly lifts when a wash of water is applied. Even lightly will kill a watercolor or colored ink wash. As long as you don't care about it being absolutely waterproof, this is a great ink, but if you require absolute waterPROOF (as opposed to water "resistant"), then this is NOT the ink you want.

review/text: Good ink. Just make sure you shake it. I've been researching the blue bullet proof ink as well. Main reason why I buy this particular ink (among the many Noodler's inks) is that this one is bulletproof. I learned that it is non-messy to use a syringe to refill the pen.

review/summary: Takes a long time to dry
review/text: It is nice to have a fountain pen ink that is water proof. However, in this particular case it is at the cost of having an ink that takes forever to dry. This it almost impossible to use for left handed people, and one must accept the fact that when writing on multiple pages, there will be ink smears on the pages that touch each other. It's definitely good to have when signing documents or checks, but one can use a simple permanent pen from any office store for that limited use. Buyer beware!

review/summary: Very good ink, the best for fountain pens.
review/text: I bought this ink the same time I bought a new fountain pen, So I immediately filled up the converter and went to work with it. It's the best ink for fountain pens that I've used in a long time. It dries almost instantly after writing. i did a test after reading one of the reviews and scribbled some things on a sheet of notebook paper, then ran the faucet with the page under water. The ink stays on the page. It doesn't wash off! It's great! I'm going to use this for check writing as well as school, now that I'm starting college in the fall, among other things as well.

review/summary: Watery gray; not black.
review/text: I own a Lamy Safari EF pen. I purchased the Noodler's ink due to all the positive reviews. To say that I am vastly disappointed... would be an _understatement_.I purchased the bottle 6-months ago. After first filling my cartridge, I was immediately displeased as the ink was a dark gray color, NOT BLACK. So, I searched the reviews on here and saw complaints about the same issue. However, people suggested that shaking the bottle repeatedly would mix the pigment and thus make it black again. Well, I shook it forcefully for about 20 seconds and refilled the cartridge. No difference whatsoever. So, I emptied the tube and shook it again, this time for 60-seconds. Again, absolutely no difference.So, now 6-months later I found myself needing to refill the pen's cartridge again. Mind you, I stored the ink in a dark drawer, which has not seen the light-of-day since I placed it in there 6-months ago. Low-and-behold absolutely no change / darkening in color. It's still a watery gray color.I would never buy anything Noodlers produces ever again. This was an absolute waste of money for me.Bottom line: if you're a gambling man, or woman, then spin the wheel and hope you get lucky. But, judging by the other reviewers who experienced the same gray color, Noodlers total lack of quality control will be keeping me far, far away from anything they sell.

review/summary: Smells a little funky, but works fantastically
review/text: There's honestly not that much to say. After all, its plain ol' black ink. Dries reasonably fast (10-20 seconds). And a word of advice before you open the jar up: the container is filled all the way to the very top. So open it slowly, gently, and on a flat surface. Oh and it doesn't really show through paper. As in, you write "Noodler's Ink" on one side of a paper, then flip the paper over and you can see the pressure point from when you applied pressure to get the ink onto the paper.Fantastic ink, a bit on the pricey side. But its a good value.

I often have to wait a minute for the whole page to dry before I turn the pageThe ink looks very solid and dark and I do like it; I'm giving it a 3 out of 5 mostly because of misleading "waterproof" label, and also because it bleeds easily and doesn't dry fast.

review/summary: Very unimpressed.
review/text: After buying a Lamy Safari on a whim, upon reading all of the rave reviews about Noodlers Ink I decided I would give it a shot. Unfortunately, I cannot share the enthusiasm other people have about this ink.Since I am new to fountain pens, I don't have a lot to compare it to other than the default cartridge the Safari comes with. Whereas the default cartridge wrote smoothly and, aside for a few issues here and there, consistently, the Noodlers Ink comes out unevenly and only when it feels like coming out. I find myself having to rewrite letters/words every sentence or so, which makes writing an incredible nuisance. The Lamy cartridge put down a dark color, while this Noodlers comes out a dull grey for me, despite hearing claims of it being extremely black.And finally, being a lefty, quickly-drying ink is of utmost importance. I would have to try pretty hard to get the Lamy cartridge's ink to smudge, but the Noodlers takes an immensely long time to dry, forcing me to do all-too-familiar hand acrobatics games as I write. It is no exaggeration to say that this ink was still wet after five minutes. Maybe it's a good thing that the ink doesn't come out consistently after all!Basically, my point is this: I couldn't really be more displeased with this ink than I am. If I hadn't used the Lamy cartridge before having tried this ink, I probably would have felt as though buying the pen was a gigantic waste of money. I'm not turned off from fountain pens yet, but I am turned off of this ink. Perhaps it works well for those of you with larger nibs, but it is next to useless in my EF. I'm not sure what to do with the rest of this bottle, or what ink I should try next. Sigh.

review/summary: THIS IS NOT WATERPROOF!
review/text: I bought two bottles of this product for ink and watercolor sketching based on the description on this page,and paid to have them delivered overnight for an impending trip. They arrived, and the ink is DEFINITELY not waterproof--certainly not suitable for taking a watercolor wash over the lines. Disappointing, to say the least. I'm told Noodler's Lexington Gray is a good waterproof choice for sketching, but haven't tried it yet.

review/summary: Too thin
review/text: I purchased this after reading the great reviews and information at the manufacturer's website. This ink is waterproof. But it is also very thin, permeates nibs and runs all over the metal part of the nib. If you use a paper that is not very absorbent it may work, or on checks. But on normal paper, it flares and distorts writing. The color when dried is not totally black but a dark gray.

review/summary: Great except for the bottle
review/text: I love this ink. It has served me well in the months that I've had my first refillable fountain pen. But there is just one problem with it: My ink chamber is removable and that is how I fill it, by placing the open end in the ink and drawing it up with the screw plunger. But now that I'm a good way into the bottle, it's height has become an issue. I'm running out of ink that I can reach with the cartridge. I've tried to fill it with the nib on, but I always get a significant amount of air in with it. But aside from the slightly poor design of the bottle, I would recommend this ink for its quality to anyone with a fountain pen.

review/summary: Noodler's Ink
review/text: I was using a nonpermanent ink which reduced the number of times & situations to use my pen. What a surprise. The Noodler's ink is not only permanent, but it flows much more smoothly than I even guessed ink could flow. I used a fountain pen in high school and gave it up because the pen leaked everywhere. I tried again a few years ago and the pen broke in less than a year. I thought I'd try one more time. As I still had bottled ink left over,I decided I'd use that before purchasing any new ink. I'm glad my thriftiness did not overcome my desire for permanence. I was very surprised. Very smooth writing ink,AMAZING! No tug or pull on the paper and it doesn't seem to bleed through. I prefer a blue ink, but haven't yet found any. Besides, I really like this ink...I'll probably just adjust myself to writing in black.

review/summary: My new favorite
review/text: I got this for the TWSBI 540 EF nib pen. The Monte Blanc black ink I was using was not dense enough for my taste. This ink is BLACK and does not look ashy after it has dried. I have used it on standard office paper (Xerox 32lb bright white), cheap yellow legal pads, and a non-Moleskin journal. It writes and dries black.I was also curious how quick it would dry. As I am a left-hander whom writes overhand (you know the weird way lefties write and everyone else says How you write like that?&#34;). So I end up dragging my hand through my writing and smudging it. Well, not with this stuff, it dries quick. Now it will smudge a little on high-gloss paper like credit card solicitations and junk mail. So if you are jotting down a honey-do list use regular paper.It says that this ink only bonds to celluloid (paper) and not your skin and I guess cloths? I can testify that it will wash off my hands with little scrubbing unlike India Ink. But I haven't gotten any on my cloths. I do question the clothing thing, since most are made of cotton, which I think is cellulose and used in paper? It's been a while since biology class, I may be in left field on that one.All in all, well worth the money, and doesn't seem to dry out in the pen or get crusty and is rich black.

review/summary: Suggestion for Lamy EF pens
review/text: I purchased a bottle of this ink for a new Lamy EF pen. I used the ink straight out of the bottle and had problems with the ink flowing smoothly and consistently. I diluted it with an equal amount of water by pulling half of a converter with the ink, then the rest with water. (I don't see why one couldn't reverse that order.) Now the ink flows perfectly, doesn't smudge and looks great. I am glad I didn't give up on it.This is excellent ink; but if you're having problems with it, consider diluting it with water to improve its flow consistency.

review/summary: Excellent Ink
review/text: I have really enjoyed using this ink. It writes very smoothly with my Lamy Safari and doesn't bleed through. I work in a lab and have tested this ink against all the solvents I could find and it came through with flying colors. I also appreciated was that the bottle has a fairly wide mouth which makes loading easy and was filled to the brim (so be careful the first time you open it). As far as I am concerned this is the best ink on the market.

review/summary: Love this ink for all of my fountain pens
review/text: This ink stands up to my go to ink for journals, work, and recipes. It stands up to frequent coffee drips and water spots nicely, overcoming the major disadvantage to fountain pens (more so than the cliched leaking pen). The ink does not clog any of my pens, including the LAMY and a hand-made tortoise shell gold pen. Surprisingly, the ink cleans up easily.

review/summary: Noodler's and Nibs
review/text: I think the colors run true. It works on any paper any of my other inks work on. My complaint is what this ink does with the nibs. While using any of my pens (I prefer Lamy, but have the same problems in my Visconti's, Pelikan, Parkers, and Cross)the ink spreads/feathers out slightly on the slit of the nib. Thus I have a dark line of ink running down the middle of the nib whenever I use Noodler's. I don't get this problem with any other brand ink .

review/summary: Not good for LAMY fountain pens (extra fine)
review/text: I purchased this ink to be used with my extra-fine point LAMY Safary fountain pen. At first I liked the deep black color but in a few days I noticed that my pen started to clog. Even though I kept cleaning my pen with warm water, it kept happening. I switched to LAMY ink and the problem completely went away.This ink might be great for other types of pens, but if you have an extra-fine point, consider getting a different one.

review/summary: Great ink!
review/text: A few weeks ago, I bought a few disposable fountain pens to see if I liked them, and after a few days, I began using them as my primary pens. The problem was that they had (very) bad ink in them, so when I ran out of ink, I decided to attempt to refill them with Noodler's ink-- and it worked! This stuff is pitch black, and best of all, it doesn't bleed or "feather" when you're writing with it.Works well in:Pilot Varsity Disposable Fountain Pen Assorted Ink 7-Pack Pouch (90029)
