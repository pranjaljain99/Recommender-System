# Recommender-System  

**EPILOGUE:**    

Imagine a situation where a customer interacts with a very large catalogue of products. This can be movies from Netflix, items from Amazon, Music from Spotify, videos from YouTube or even the apps from play store. What really matters is how the user interacts with the catalogue. One way is if a user knows what he wants is by Search method for the precise item. But for a very large catalogue , users often don’t know what they are looking for exactly. This is where a recommendation system come in. This system recommends to the user certain items that it thinks the user will be interested in based on what they know about the user.  

The aim of this project is to analyse an available dataset from an Ecommerce business and find the hidden patterns &amp; correlating it to the trends. Recommendation engine provides a personalised information to a customer by learning its past purchase history, demographics and other interactions.  

**THEME:**  
To produce a generalised, specific and tailored recommendation to a user by observing the pattern in his purchase behaviour using transactional data from an online Ecommerce retailer. To keep on giving more specific recommendations, I have used three different
approaches and tried to explain them in the simplest of manner performing all the computations on a Jupyter notebook and providing snippets wherever necessary.  
a) Affinity based analysis – Based on Affinity Weight, Popularity, Recency
b) Similar Customer based analysis – Based on the score/rating given by the customer
c) Content based analysis – Based on the Review sentiments of the customer
